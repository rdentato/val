# NaNboxing Library Documentation

## Introduction

### Overview of NaNboxing
NaNboxing is an advanced technique used in programming languages to efficiently represent different types of data using the NaN (Not a Number) space in floating-point representation. This approach leverages the fact that IEEE 754 floating-point standard, which C adheres to, reserves a large space for representing NaN values. NaNboxing exploits this space to store additional, non-floating-point types of data like pointers, integers, or even custom data types, within the same space normally occupied by a floating-point number.

### Purpose and Benefits of the NaNboxing Library
This NaNboxing library is designed specifically for C programmers who are looking to optimize data storage and handling in their applications. The primary purposes of this library are:
- To provide an efficient way to store various data types in a uniform manner.
- To enhance performance, especially in systems where memory usage is a critical concern.
- To offer a flexible and easy-to-integrate solution for existing C projects.

The benefits of using this library include:
- Improved memory efficiency: By packing different data types into the NaN space, memory footprint can be reduced.
- Enhanced performance: Less memory usage often translates into faster access times and better cache utilization.
- Versatility: The library can be used in a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to large-scale software projects.

### Target Audience
This documentation is intended for C programmers who have a good understanding of the C language and its nuances. The ideal reader should be familiar with:
- Basic C programming concepts, such as data types, pointers, and memory management.
- Floating-point arithmetic and the IEEE 754 standard.
- Advanced programming topics such as data representation and optimization techniques.

Whether you are an experienced C developer looking to optimize your existing project or a programmer interested in exploring advanced data handling techniques in C, this documentation will guide you through the effective use of the NaNboxing library in your applications.


## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the initial steps to start using the NaNboxing library in your C projects. The setup process is straightforward, as there are no dependencies or complex installation procedures involved.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have:
- A standard C development environment set up on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C programming, including understanding of header files and the preprocessor.

No additional libraries or tools are required to use the NaNboxing library.

### Basic Setup and Initialization
To use the NaNboxing library in your C program, you only need to include the header file `val.h`. This header file contains all the necessary declarations and definitions to enable NaNboxing functionality in your project.

This approach simplifies the integration process, making it highly portable and easy to use in various environments and projects.

### Including the Header File
In your C source file, include the `val.h` header at the beginning of your file as follows:

```c
#include "val.h"
```

This single line is enough to integrate NaNboxing capabilities into your program. The `val.h` header file encapsulates all the necessary logic, data types, and functions provided by the NaNboxing library.

### Verifying the Setup
To verify that the library is correctly included in your project, you can write a simple test program that utilizes a function or a feature from the `val.h` header. Compile and run this test program to ensure everything is set up correctly.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "val.h"

int main() {
    // Test code using NaNboxing library features
    val_t x;
    val_t y;
    x = val(3);
    y = val(4.2);
    printf("x: %d y: %f\n",valtointeger(x),valtodouble(y));
    val_t t;
    t = x; x = y; y = t;     // Swap the values
    printf("x: %f y: %d\n",valtodouble(x),valtointeger(y));
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run your test program as you would with any standard C program. If it compiles without errors and runs as expected, the NaNboxing library is ready to use in your project.

With these simple steps, you are now ready to explore the full potential of NaNboxing in your C applications. The following sections of this documentation will delve into more detailed aspects of the library, including its API, usage examples, and best practices.
